# Pediatric Bone Age Prediction CNN Model With Segmentation Preprocessing

Estimate pediatric bone age is a very important task to determine skeletal maturity and monitor growth process in young patients. Till now doctors had to compare radiographies to standard ones, guessing a number of months. With the steps forward data science and deep learning technologies have reached, we think these technologies could be used to substitute human in this process letting doctors healing patients. Thanks to the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) many approaches have been presented and amazing results have been obtained. This project tries to combine best ideas taken from prior approaches to obtain even better results in terms of performance. The key part of this project is the focus on preprocessing techniques to clean data set images to let the prediction model learn more relevant features. This will be done using a U-Net architecture preparing images for a second model created with an Inception V3 architecture combined with other layers. We will show how nowadays architectures are able to overcome human specialist in accuracy and reliability, providing and easy and expandable new way of approaching this field.
